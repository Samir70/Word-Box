# Word Box
A vocabulary builder, to help learn a new language.
The app will maintain a list of words known to the user and, when a new piece of text is pasted in, the app will highlight known words in green and new words in red.

## Technology
HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript
(eventually) some way to save data someplace other than local storage.

## initial user story:
* as a learner I should be able to see a list of the words I can translate between English and (Czech)
* as a learner I should be able to paste some text into the app and have it hightlight the words I know in green and the words I don't know in red
* as a learner I should be able to click on a green word and be asked for the translation. And then have my response graded
* as a learner I should be able to click on a red word and see a list of words with a similar root from my  known words lists
* as a learner I should be able to click on a red word and have the option to look the word up in a dictionary
* as a learner I should be able to add words to my known list when I provide a translation
* as a learner I should be tested on my ability to translate model sentences between languages. These sentences can be randomly generated with words from my known list.
